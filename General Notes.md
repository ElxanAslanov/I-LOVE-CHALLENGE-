### Things to Figure Out

- Do we have to submit the draft on Friday? What to submit?
- Do we have to participate the halftime show?
- Better to sync up working time if something is under a tight collaboration



### Rough Schedule

#### Friday (DRAFT SUBMISSION - 23.59)

- Concrete idea of the app/game with a specific scenario
  - probably have to be an app to utilize HarmonyOS features even though it follows a game design
  - 
  - Sketch of the UI and refine it later
- Implementation plan
  - Categorized goals
    - Essential: interactive, responsive parts
    - Better to have: could be some static/interactive UI, without callback functions
    - Possible for extra features: ignore or put static UI there
  - Determined tech stack

#### Saturday (HALFTIME SHOW - 18)

TBD

#### Sunday (SUBMISSION - 9)

TBD



key points:

- when are the middle checkpoints, or do we need?
- when to start making videos, storyboard? narrator/voice-over?
- when to start to sum up things and make up repository



### Tasks Management

- Github Project - kanban board for tracking tasks
- Github Issues - for listing, assigning and noting TODOs
- Working time: TBD if needed
  - online in Discord channel, and prepared for a call or screen share
